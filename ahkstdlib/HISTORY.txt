    HISTORY
    
2010-09-18

    * General: I have set the read-only flag on all files which should prevent changes from end user (doc, lib, licenses, samp, tools).
    * General: Some small changes in database *ini* data and header, without making a note.

    * GUI: Bug. Incorrect date was displayed on title of gui.
    * GUI: Bug. If search result have a clear list, then the current selected item is nothing too.
    * GUI: Bug. The clean button [X] should set to first entry and update the title correctly.
    * GUI: Bug. Run Example button had to be pushed twice to work, if current active tab was not the Example tab.
        
    * GUI: Improved. Some improvements to core script and rearrangements of gui.
    
    * GUI: New. A small notification at right upper corner of gui is shown, if an update to the collection is available.
    * GUI: New. Added button for compare two sources. Button is available only, if the source is installed AND MD5 
        checksum differs. Otherwise it wouldn`t make sense to compare identical files. Text Compare v2 by jaco0646 
        was modified so it can be used without a gui.
